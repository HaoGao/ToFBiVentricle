31-10-2019 trying to regenrate the abaqus simulation files which can be used for HO model  DONE
		AbaqusMeshGeneration_HO: seems working fine, and able to generate abaqus input file properly
		the basenode set is named NODE_BASE
		the whole body section set: SOLID_BODY
		the fibre file is: fibTotal.inp
		Instance name is: PAET-1_1
		LV_ENDO_SURFACE

1-11-2019 running with abaqus standard, working
       DONE: adding LV and RV element sets, hopping this can be used to define material property differently in RV and LV 
	   DONE: displacement extracted and checked
	   DONE: extract the volume for RV and LV
	               introduce the optimization_config file in resultDir, and optmization related setting up will be saved in optimization_opt data structure
		     to be done: check with Solidworks, what are the difference will be

04-11-2019 setting up RV and LV with different material properties 
        Done: with same material properties
		Done: with different material properties, manually updated fine
		Done: Division according to the planes, seems fine, code name: LVDivision_17Segments_AHA, right ventricle is seperated

05-11-2019 updating to Sommer SEF
        Done: using standardardized material model
		Done: write out input file according to different material models
		to do: setting up an explicit solver

18-11-2019 run optimization procedure
        Done: Matlab to call Abaqus and post-processing, seems fine to me for volume calculation
		Done: extract the strain either at endo 
		Done: average from endo and epi, which needs some extra post-processing

19-11-19 Ca-Cb test to be done
        Done: test case
		
20-11-19 Ca-CB case
        Done: with left ventricle, by changing Ca Cb and Klotz

12-12-19 Ca-Cb-CaRV 
		Done: updating right ventricle
		to be done: updating af,bf for left ventricle and Ca_RV for the right side, need to run and see how it works
		
13-12-19 Af Bf for strain comparison
